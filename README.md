# IOT Base Kit Sketches

This contains sample code and hookup information to control and use the parts of the IOT kit

In general, wiring will be color coded:
* Red: Power (check for 3v3 or VCC)
* Black: Ground
* Yellow: Data (I2C, from Qwiic)
* Blue: Clock (I2c, from Qwiic)

Other wire colors will be chosen to differentiate connections
